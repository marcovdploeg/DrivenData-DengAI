# DrivenData-DengAI

This repository contains the code to obtain my results for the DengAI practice competition on DrivenData.

Applied methods in these scrpits are: machine learning using XGBoost, preprocessing (feature engineering, lag features), hyperparameter optimisation.

As I'm not super satisfied by the model performance, I might come back to try and improve it further at some point.
